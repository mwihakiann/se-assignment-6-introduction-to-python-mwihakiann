# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Key features include:

Readability and Simplicity: Clean and easy-to-read syntax.
Interpreted Language: Executes code line-by-line, which simplifies debugging.
Dynamic Typing: Variables do not require explicit declaration of their type.
Extensive Standard Library: A rich set of modules and functions for various tasks.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
Community and Ecosystem: A large and active community with extensive documentation and third-party libraries.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Analysis and Machine Learning: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
Scripting and Automation: Automating repetitive tasks.
Game Development: Using libraries like Pygame.
Scientific Computing: Using libraries like SciPy.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

 Windows:
Download the installer from the official Python website.
Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
Follow the installation steps.

Verify Installation:
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
python --version
Set up a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

  Hello World Program:

python
Copy code
print("Hello, World!") 

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Basic Data Types:

int: Integer numbers.
float: Floating-point numbers.
str: String literals.
bool: Boolean values (True or False).
list: Ordered, mutable collections.
dict: Key-value pairs.
Script Demonstrating Variables:

python
 code
# Integer
a = 10
# Float
b = 3.14
# String
c = "Python"
# Boolean
d = True

print(a, b, c, d)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements:

python
 code
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops:

python
 code
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1   

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

  Definition and Usage:
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks.

Example Function:

python
 code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(2, 3)
print(result) 

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Differences:

Lists: Ordered, indexed by position, mutable.
Dictionaries: Unordered, indexed by keys, mutable.
Script Demonstrating Lists and Dictionaries:

python
 code
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0])  # Accessing elements

# Dictionary
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print(person['name'])  # Accessing elements

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("This block executes no matter what")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Concepts:

Modules: Single Python files with .py extension.
Packages: Directories containing multiple modules and a special __init__.py file.
Importing and Using a Module:
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

  Reading from a File:

python
 code
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a File:

python
Copy code
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")  

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
